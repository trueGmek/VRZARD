# VRZARD

## DESCRIPTION

**VRZARD** is a VR escape room game that uses an BCI as control mechanism. This work was created for my bachelor thesis at Łódź University of Technology in Poland.

This project was created to investigate research hypothesis: *Using BCI as player input modality for mind-related mechanics results in enhanced immersion*.

## STORYLINE

The  game  takes  place  in  a  fantasy  world  resembling  the  medieval  era.   The  plotline  of  the game is inspired by the practice of witch hunt in middle ages, where individuals accused of witchcraft were subjected to death penalty. Throughout the game, the player impersonates a protagonist,  who is equipped with supernatural abilities - telekinesis and so-called "Alternative Vision". The telekinesis ability enables the player to lift objects without physically interacting with them, and the "Alternative Vision" provides him with capacity to notice and detect magical phenomena.  Alike in the middle ages, in the world of the game any magical or supernatural activity is strictly forbidden and recognised as heresy and felony. In the beginning, the protagonist finds himself detained in a cell and awaiting a witchcraft trial. The game starts when the main character decides that he must escape, realising that he is subject to execution for heresy.  Through the game, the player’s task is to guide the protagonist along his prison break and enable him to escape the death penalty.
